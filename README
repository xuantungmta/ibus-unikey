Clone of iBus-Unikey for fixing some crash.

Todo list:
1. Refactoring to gain some inside or at least familiar with ibus-unikey code base.
2. Convert from autotool to cmake.
3. Update with upstream unikey engine.
4. Add automated test. But how do we known if this project is done/ornot. Any Telex / VNI specification for reference?
5. Now, if ever we reach to this point, then what?
